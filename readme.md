# vim-like navigation for the hot dorg borg in Chrome. #
Basically, this is just a greasemonkey-like script, because I need to vimify everything.

## On the main page
+ `j` and `k` navigate thread titles, just like navigating conversations in Gmail.
+ `Enter` opens the highlighted thread.

## Anywhere else
+ `u` returns you to the main page, unless the new post textarea currently has focus.

# Where is it
+ [here](http://badfriend.org/bco_gmail/bco_gmail.crx), for now. 
+ `sha256sum` is `7bb68305cf122d5b242832a8cffee0219df0cfd9328dc5377dd8f16bd909ead3`.
